# AXI4-Lite Protocol Interfaced with Memory

## üìù Description

This project demonstrates the integration of the **AXI4-Lite (Advanced eXtensible Interface - Lite)** protocol with a simple memory module. AXI4-Lite is a lightweight subset of the AXI4 protocol, widely used in SoC architectures for control register access. This design illustrates how to use AXI4-Lite signals to perform read and write operations on a memory block, implemented in Verilog HDL.

## üîß Modules Description

### 1. `axi_lite_master.v`
- Initiates AXI4-Lite read/write transactions.
- Generates signals: `AWVALID`, `WVALID`, `ARVALID`, `BREADY`, `RREADY`, `AWADDR`, `WDATA`, etc.

### 2. `axi_lite_slave.v`
- Decodes AXI4-Lite transactions.
- Integrated with the memory block.
- Responds with `BRESP`, `BVALID`, `RDATA`, `RVALID`.

### 3. `top.v`
- Connects the AXI4-Lite master and slave.
- Top-level module to integrate all components.

### 4. `tb_top.v`
- Testbench to simulate AXI4-Lite read/write operations.
- Generates clock and reset.
- Monitors outputs and validates correct operation.

## üß™ Testbench Features

- Simulates:
  - Write operation to a specific memory address.
  - Read operation from the same address.
  - Checks correctness of `RDATA` during read.
- Outputs observed using `$display` or waveform viewer.
